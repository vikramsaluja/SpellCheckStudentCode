| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sept 25 |  1:00-1:45pm  |                                    My original thoughts on how to appraoch this problem set would be to use binary search but now I am trying to think about how to make those comparisons. During this time I also tried to think about if there was a way to have some sort of constant look up time with the array an array but I am a bit stuck and was not able to make much progress. I am also trying to think about a way to approach this problem with the comparisons we talked about in class. |
| Sept 29 | 10:55-11:30am |  I know that I could solve this problem using binary search but I am trying to think of another way to approach it which could be more efficent. I am trying to think about I could minimize the number of comparisons I have, so I am trying to think of a way if I could start by comparing just the prefixs of the words to have less comparisons. I am not search if that would actually be more efficent then binary search but if I could minimize the number of words that may help its effciency. |
