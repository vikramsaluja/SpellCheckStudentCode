| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sept 25 |  1:00-1:45pm  |                                                                     My original thoughts on how to appraoch this problem set would be to use binary search but now I am trying to think about how to make those comparisons. During this time I also tried to think about if there was a way to have some sort of constant look up time with the array an array but I am a bit stuck and was not able to make much progress. I am also trying to think about a way to approach this problem with the comparisons we talked about in class. |
| Sept 29 | 10:50-11:30am |                                   I know that I could solve this problem using binary search but I am trying to think of another way to approach it which could be more efficent. I am trying to think about I could minimize the number of comparisons I have, so I am trying to think of a way if I could start by comparing just the prefixs of the words to have less comparisons. I am not search if that would actually be more efficent then binary search but if I could minimize the number of words that may help its effciency. |
| Sept 29 |  5:00-6:00pm  | During this time I continued to think about how I could minimize the number of comparisons. I began to realize that I could create an arraylist to hold all of the words so that at each index I could then have a value that would represent each word. This would allow me to make direct comparisons but I am still not sure how I would go about that. I tried to write out some psudocode. I am not sure if this is this is the right track but as of right now I think if I can continue to think about it more it might make sense. |
| Sept 30 |  4:30-5:20pm  |                                                                                          During this time I continued to think about the idea of being able to make direct comparisons with the word and the dictionary. I am trying to figure out if I use ascii values then how I could do that. The main issue with adding the values or something like that being that 2 words could have the same value. I did some research to try and find out a way to do this but am still not sure but I think that I might have the right idea. |
