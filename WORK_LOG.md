| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sept 25 |  1:00-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                           My original thoughts on how to appraoch this problem set would be to use binary search but now I am trying to think about how to make those comparisons. During this time I also tried to think about if there was a way to have some sort of constant look up time with the array an array but I am a bit stuck and was not able to make much progress. I am also trying to think about a way to approach this problem with the comparisons we talked about in class. |
| Sept 29 | 10:50-11:30am |                                                                                                                                                         I know that I could solve this problem using binary search but I am trying to think of another way to approach it which could be more efficent. I am trying to think about I could minimize the number of comparisons I have, so I am trying to think of a way if I could start by comparing just the prefixs of the words to have less comparisons. I am not search if that would actually be more efficent then binary search but if I could minimize the number of words that may help its effciency. |
| Sept 29 |  5:00-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                       During this time I continued to think about how I could minimize the number of comparisons. I began to realize that I could create an arraylist to hold all of the words so that at each index I could then have a value that would represent each word. This would allow me to make direct comparisons but I am still not sure how I would go about that. I tried to write out some psudocode. I am not sure if this is this is the right track but as of right now I think if I can continue to think about it more it might make sense. |
| Sept 30 |  4:30-5:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                During this time I continued to think about the idea of being able to make direct comparisons with the word and the dictionary. I am trying to figure out if I use ascii values then how I could do that. The main issue with adding the values or something like that being that 2 words could have the same value. I did some research to try and find out a way to do this but am still not sure but I think that I might have the right idea. |
| Oct 7   | 12:30-1:45pm  |                                                                   In this period I completed by trie. I used recursion and the main challenge was that I needed to understand what the paramenter would be. I then figured out that I could use depth which would represent the charecter that was being proccessed. Once I figured that it was clear since insert builds paths and then lookup() follows it. During this period I also completed the SpellCheck and I initally thought that I would just use 1 trie for the dictionary but then I realized that I would need another trie because I need to handle duplicates as well and only count them once. |
| Oct 9   | 11:00-11:55pm |                                                                                                                                                            In this work period I began to start my TST. My thinking changed sine at the start I did not realize that I needed another node class for TST but as I began to try and code my TST I realized that I would need different so I could keep track of left, right, and middle nodes from the root. I then began to write my TST class with inserting the words and something that I am still working on. The main way my thinking changed was figuring out that I needed a differnt class for TST node. |
| Oct 12  |  6:00-7:25pm  |  As I continued to work on my TST class I made my code based off of my Trie class. I was a bit confused on how to implement the TST since I would not have an array of child ndoes but I then realized that I have to create three different paths to see which way to go. That is where I came up with the comparisons that take place in "current" to the letter and also to the word legnth. Doing these comparisons felt really similar to a binary search tree which is how I tried to think about it. In doing this I was able to compelete the problem set and I then implemented the SpellCheck code is a very similar way to how I did it for the trie. |
