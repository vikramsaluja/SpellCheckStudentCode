| Sept 25 | 1:00-1:45pm | My original thoughts on how to appraoch this problem set would be to use binary search but now I am trying to think about how to make those comparisons. During this time I also tried to think about if there was a way to have some sort of constant look up time with the array an array but I am a bit stuck and was not able to make much progress. I am also trying to think about a way to approach this problem with the comparisons we talked about in class.  |
